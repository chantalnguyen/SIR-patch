# SIR-patch

Code for solving master equation for the SIR model in an arbitrary number of patches/subpopulations.
Adapted from [Nguyen & Carlson 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152950), which solves the master equation for 2 interacting populations, and which is in turn adapted from [Jenkinson & Goutsias 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036160).
